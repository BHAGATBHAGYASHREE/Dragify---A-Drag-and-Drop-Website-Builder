# Dragdrop - A Drag-and-Drop Website Builder

Dragdrop is a simple and intuitive drag-and-drop website builder prototype. The project is built using React.js and provides a modern, user-friendly interface to create customizable websites. Users can drag elements (such as text, images, and buttons) onto a canvas and modify their properties via forms.

## Features
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Easily drag and position elements on a predefined template structure.
- **Element Customization**: Modify properties (like text content, image URLs, and button labels) via the provided form.
- **Responsive Design**: The builder works seamlessly across both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Future Scalability**: Designed with scalability in mind to allow for more templates and elements in the future.
- **Code Quality**: The project uses clean, well-organized code following modern best practices.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/BHAGATBHAGYASHREE/Dragify---A-Drag-and-Drop-Website-Builder.git

### 2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd dragdrop

### 3. Install the required dependencies:
npm install

### 4. Start the development server:
npm run dev

## Project Structure

- **src/**: The main source code for the app.

- **components/** : Contains React components like Canvas.jsx, Element.jsx, and ElementForm.jsx.

- **App.jsx**: The main component that handles the overall layout.

- **App.css**: Global styles for the application.

- **Element.css**: Styles specifically for individual elements (text, image, button).

  ## How It Works
 - **Sidebar**:
      The sidebar contains buttons to add various types of elements (text, image, button) to the canvas.

      Users can add elements by clicking on the respective buttons for Text, Image, and Button. Each click adds the respective element to the canvas.

 - **Canvas**:
      The canvas is where users can drag and drop elements. Users can position, modify, and remove elements on the canvas.

      Once elements are added, they can be dragged and dropped to the desired position.

 - **Element Forms**:
    For each element on the canvas, there is a form to customize its properties. This includes setting text for text elements, providing an image URL for images, and changing button   labels.

 - **Responsiveness**:
The layout is designed to work on both mobile and desktop screens.

## Project Goals
 - **User Experience:** Focused on providing an intuitive and fluid user experience with smooth drag-and-drop interactions.

 - **Customization:** Users can personalize each element using the forms, offering a flexible web-building environment.

 - **Responsiveness:** The app adapts well to both mobile and desktop screen sizes.

 - **Scalability:** The code is designed to allow easy expansion by adding more elements and templates in the future.

## Future Enhancements
 - **Element Resizing:** Allow users to resize elements on the canvas for better layout customization.

 - **Additional Element Types:** Add more element types like images, forms, and headers.

 - **Template Selection:** Implement predefined templates to allow users to start with a basic layout.

 - **Save/Export Functionality:** Allow users to save their projects or export the website as HTML files.
